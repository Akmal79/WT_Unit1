If you want to find all HTML elements with the same class name, use getElementsByClassName().

Finding HTML Elements by CSS Selectors
If you want to find all HTML elements that match a specified CSS selector (id, class names, types, attributes, values of attributes, etc), use the querySelectorAll() method.
